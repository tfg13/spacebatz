serious coding guidelines:

- javadoc *everything*
- prefer crashing the game over catching too many exceptions
- comments/javadoc in german, identifiers & names in english
- getters and setters for struct-like objects are no longer recommended
- do not break anything on branch master
- google "loose coupling"
- use the damn github bug tracker YOU (yes, you) ARE PAYING FOR IT DAMMIT
