FEATURES:

    - fast:        datatransfer is UDP-only
    -              automatic lerp-minimalization on a per-client basis
    -              automatic load-balancing with prioritys and aging
    - predictable: during normal operation, exactly one packet is transmitted per tick
    - stable:      automatically detects timeouts/lags via heartbeat-signals
    -              automatic (full) resync on catastrophic packet loss / connection interrupt
    - flexible:    user-commands in seperate classes/objects, (de)registerable at runtime
    - secure:      built-in support for MAC (message authentication code)
    - reliable:    message delivery is guaranteed
    - misc:        no connection required --> no time required for setting up and connecting sockets etc
