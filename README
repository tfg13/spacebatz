A fast-paced, top-down, co-op 2D game featuring:

* Robots
* Mining
* Crafting
* Shooting/Fighting
* Exploring
* Space travel
* Quests

Unfortunately we no longer have the time to work on this.
So here it is, unfinished but with a lot of ideas and some fancy code (subtile hint: the networking code!).
